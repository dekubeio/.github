# dekube

O traveler, you who have arrived at these gates — know that the path behind you remains open. You may still turn back. None shall judge the wise who flee.

**[Documentation](https://docs.dekube.io/)** — for those who choose to proceed.

### The concept

You deploy with Helm charts or helmfiles. Your users, your dev setup, or your NAS just need `docker compose up`. dekube generates `compose.yml` from your Kubernetes manifests — one source of truth, no second stack to maintain — just regrets.

Three components: **dekube-engine** (*the mad scribe*) converts the manifests, **extensions** (*the monks and the damned*) extend it beyond built-in kinds — CRD providers, converters, transforms, tomorrow whatever Yog Sa'rath demands — and **dekube-manager** (*the dark priest*) downloads and orchestrates everything.
